# Introduction

The Logitech WingMan Formula GP series, released on August 30, 2000, are classic PC racing wheels that offer a solid driving experience but lack native PlayStation 4 support. Fortunately, with a few lightweight and **free software** tools, you can bridge this gap and enjoy your favorite PS4 racing games using any wheel, with no expensive adapters required.

This guide will show you, step by step, how to set up your WingMan Formula Force GP (or any other) steering wheel to work with your PlayStation 4 via Remote Play for input purposes.

**Note:** The wheel may move or self-center when first powered on, this is normal. 

<div class="step">
    <h3>Step 2: Configure XOutput</h3>
</div>

1. [Download and install ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases).
2. [Download XOutput](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput/releases), extract it, and run the executable.
3. Confirm that your steering wheel appears in XOutput once connected:

    </p>
4. Click on _Edit_, and map your wheel's axes and buttons to XInput (Xbox controller format) according to your preference. You can use my custom configuration below as a reference:
    ```ini
    [Logitech WingMan Formula Force GP USB(<your_UUID>)]
    SelectedDPad=-1
    StartWhenConnected=false
    A=Axis2,51,90,0
    B=Axis2,15,52,0
    X=Button6,0,100,0
    Y=Button5,0,100,0
    L1=Button1,0,100,0
    R1=Button2,0,100,0
    L3=Axis1,0,0,0
    R3=Button6,0,0,0
    Start=Button3,0,100,0
    Back=Button1,0,0,0
    Home=Button1,0,0,0
    UP=Button2,0,100,0
    DOWN=Button1,0,100,0
    LEFT=Button6,0,100,0
    RIGHT=Button4,0,100,0
    LX=Axis1,23,77,0
    LY=Button1,50,50,0
    RX=Axis1,50,50,0
    RY=Button1,50,50,0
    L2=Axis2,55,24,0
    R2=Axis2,50,84,0
    ```
5. Once you're happy with your configuration, click on _Start_.

<div class="step">
    <h3>Step 3: Patch RemotePlay</h3>
</div>

1. [Download and install RemotePlay v5.5.0.8250](https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html).
2. [Download the RemotePlay Version Patcher](https://github.com/xeropresence/remoteplay-version-patcher/releases), extract it, and run its executable to patch RemotePlay to the latest version.

The version patcher will enable you to auto-connect to your PlayStation 4 without needing to manually enter a new code every time.

<div class="step">
    <h3>Step 4: Connect Everything</h3>
</div>

1. [Download DS4Emulator](https://github.com/r57zone/DualShock4-emulator/releases).
2. Turn-on your Playstation 4, and start your favorite racing game.
3. Launch the patched RemotePlay app. The first time you run it, it may ask you to log in with your PlayStation Network account. You'll have to manually connect to your PlayStation 4 using a code. To do this, go to _Settings_ > _Remote Play Connection Settings_ > _Add Device_ and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Once in-game, run the DS4Emulator executable. RemotePlay should recognize DS4Emulator as a genuine DualShock 4 controller, allowing you to play with your wheel!

**Note:** For the best gameplay experience, connect your PS4 directly to your display via HDMI and use Remote Play only for controller input. This minimizes display lag compared to streaming. For optimal stability, connect both your PS4 and PC to your network via ethernet cable.
