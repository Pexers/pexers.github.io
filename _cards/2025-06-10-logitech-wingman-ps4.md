# Introduction

The Logitech WingMan Formula GP series, released on August 30, 2000, are classic PC racing wheels that offer a solid driving experience but lack native PlayStation 4 support. Fortunately, with a few lightweight and **free software** tools, you can bridge this gap and enjoy your favorite PS4 racing games using any wheel, with no expensive adapters required.

This guide will show you, step by step, how to set up your WingMan Formula Force GP (or any other) steering wheel to work with your PlayStation 4 via Remote Play for input purposes.

# Step-by-Step Guide

<div class="step">
    <h3>Step 1: Install and Configure XOutput</h3>
</div>

1. [Download XOutput](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput/releases) and extract it.
2. Connect your steering wheel to your PC via USB. Confirm it appears in XOutput:

    </p>
3. In XOutput, click on _Edit_ and map your wheel's axes and buttons to XInput (Xbox controller format) according to your preference. You can find my custom configuration below as reference:
    ```ini
    [Logitech WingMan Formula Force GP USB(<your_UUID>)]
    SelectedDPad=-1
    StartWhenConnected=false
    A=Axis2,51,90,0
    B=Axis2,15,52,0
    X=Button6,0,100,0
    Y=Button5,0,100,0
    L1=Button1,0,100,0
    R1=Button2,0,100,0
    L3=Axis1,0,0,0
    R3=Button6,0,0,0
    Start=Button3,0,100,0
    Back=Button1,0,0,0
    Home=Button1,0,0,0
    UP=Button2,0,100,0
    DOWN=Button1,0,100,0
    LEFT=Button6,0,100,0
    RIGHT=Button4,0,100,0
    LX=Axis1,23,77,0
    LY=Button1,50,50,0
    RX=Axis1,50,50,0
    RY=Button1,50,50,0
    L2=Axis2,55,24,0
    R2=Axis2,50,84,0
    ```
4. Test the mapping to ensure all buttons and axes respond correctly.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If buttons or axes do not respond, check your mappings in XOutput and DS4Emulator.
- Ensure only one XInput device is active to avoid conflicts.
- If RemotePlay does not recognize the controller, restart all applications and reconnect your devices.

**Congratulations!** You can now use your classic PC steering wheel to play PS4 games. üèÅ
