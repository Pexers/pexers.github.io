# Introduction

In March 2022, I purchased my Oral-B Vitality 100 CrossAction electric toothbrush. After two years of daily use, the battery began requiring frequent recharging, often several times a week. Instead of spending arout 20€ on a new toothbrush, I chose to replace the battery myself with a brand new Eneloop NiMh cell, which would cost you roughly 3€ a piece. This way we're able to save money, and most importantly, contribute to less electronic waste.
