# Introduction

In March 2022, I purchased my Oral-B Vitality 100 CrossAction electric toothbrush. After two years of daily use, the battery began requiring frequent recharging, often several times a week. Instead of spending arout 20€ on a new toothbrush, I chose to replace the battery myself with a brand new Eneloop NiMh cell, which would cost you roughly 3€ a piece. This way we're able to save money, and most importantly, contribute to less electronic waste.

Begin by gathering the necessary tools and materials for the battery replacement. Make sure you have a suitable replacement battery, a small screwdriver, and a clean workspace.
